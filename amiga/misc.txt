* Standard 1M ROM addresses are: "extended" 0xe00000-0xe7ffff and "normal" at 0xf80000-0xffffff. All Amiga models that support 1M ROMs use above addresses.

* I know that the A600 supports 1M roms. There are other models that support this?
* A500 (later revisions), A1200, CD32. A600 and A1200 support max 2M ROMs. (second 1M at 0xa80000-0xb7ffff)
* What about A3000's? - AFAIK it also has 512K limit (Fat Gary limitation)

It's even easier - you just concatenate them together.

ACATune will detect the 1M rom and put everything in the right place - it's how I test on my A1200.

I think its ext-then-rom... or maybe rom-then-ext.

One of them will work.
